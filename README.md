# INKBIRD IBS-M1 Decoder
Script to retrieve temperature from IBS-P01 sensor with the IBS-M1 gateway.

Looks like there are differente version of the same sensor and gateway and each one uses a different encode. I've left some comments at the code, you can try change some values to make it work better for you.

3 - Open your terminal and type `npm install`.
4 - Open the `index.mjs` file on a text/code editor.
